# some bilibili css

hi. this is some bilibili custom userscript that i used and modified over the course of months.

i randomly adjusted things when i see things i dont like.

doesnt support customization, because i made this for myself.

**Usage:**

dump all of them them into [stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/) and turn them all on

adjust a few settings if they need to (like changing to dark mode or what. i forgor)

then finished

also you should not use the new version of UI on bilibili

that sh*t sucks and it breaks the code
